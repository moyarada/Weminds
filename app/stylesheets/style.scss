// (except media) by uncommeting this line
//@include html5-boilerplate;

// Or, you can pick and choose only the sections

@include html5-boilerplate-reset;
@include html5-boilerplate-fonts;
@include html5-boilerplate-styles;
@include html5-boilerplate-helpers;

// Or, you can import the "overrides" partial if
// you want more control over individual mixins

// Finally, put your own styles in these partials

@import "partials/fonts";

// Media should come last
